        <p>Hey thanks for checking out my blog.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I recently quit all social media because it generally did not add any benefit to my life any more. On the contrary, it often reminded me of things i needed to let go or showed me content I did not ask for. Thinking I need to put up with it for networking purposes, I stayed on these platforms too far beyond the start of my resentment towards them.<br><br>This year has been profoundly formative and I realized that putting my face in front of a camera for promotion purposes or to chase the attention of algorithms is not what I want to do with my music. Moreover, after playing six CatmintOD shows, I already feel exhausted. Although 2024 was exhilarating, I was under a constant stress, which affected my writing and general well-being because of the organisational aspects. But I love playing for other people and having a band of such inspiring and kind creatives around me, so the thought of going outside again lives in my head.<br><br>However, I will not attempt to shove my narcissism into anyone's face and rob us both of our time. You will now receive updates about CatmintOD via this blog and SoundCloud exclusively. Maybe there will be a newsletter in the future, if i figure out how to do that.<br>This is now the place where I will share thoughts, memories and stories. Stay for as long as you want, but not any longer.<br><br>Yours,<br>Tim</p>
