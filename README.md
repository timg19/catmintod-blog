This is a website i created for my music project. It is supposed to be updated regularly with updates about my creation process.
Currently I explain why I pivoted from social media to this small-web solution and link to my work on several streaming platforms.
I also have a page where I document the equipment I use, which is also a work-in-progress.

I mainly drew from my knowledge about HTML and CSS which I accumulated over the summer via FreeCodeCamp.
For some quick bugfixes that I missed, I used ChatGPT, because I use all the time for various purposes.
